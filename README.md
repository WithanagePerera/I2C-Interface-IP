# I2C-Interface-IP
A VHDL implementation of an I2C interface that supports both master and slave operation.

I've been wanting to gain more experience with embedded interfaces and to truly understand the architecture instead of calling pre-defined drivers and modules.

I'll be deploying this on my DE-10 Lite to have it communicate with an STM32 Nucleo. Afterwards, I'll attempt communication between 2 DE-10s.
